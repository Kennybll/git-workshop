### Is this workshop for me?
If you are fairly new to (or would like to get into) programming and app development, this may be a great fit for you - especially if you have not yet used version control tools.  This workshop may be beneficial to those who have used Git but would like to better understand how it works.

### What you'll need
- A laptop with [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed
- A GitHub account ([you can create one for free](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github))
- An appetite (we'll have pizza and beverages available)
- A desire to learn!

__Don't have a laptop to use?__ No worries; we'll have extra machines available for you to borrow for the workshop.  Just let us know you need one when you RSVP for the event.

### What you'll learn
- The basic concepts of Git and why version control is important
- [Basic commands](https://git-scm.com/docs) such as `status`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `clone`, `branch`, and more
- How to use Git-powered platforms to perform a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
